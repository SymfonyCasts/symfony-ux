# Form Submits & The Preview Feature

One of the cooler features of Turbo Drive is its snapshot feature, which we know
about already. When we visit a page that we've already been to, like Office
Supplies or Furniture, it instantly shows the snapshot while it waits for the new
Ajax call to finish in the background. And when we hit back, it instantly shows the
snapshot with *no* Ajax call.

This feature, which is *great* for making your site feel *really* snappy - is,
I'll admit, one of the most *problematic* when it comes to perfecting your site
with Turbo Drive.

## Snapshots and Form Submits

Let's see one problem. Head over to the registration page and fill out the form
incorrectly: I'll use a bogus email address and hit enter. Cool. The form submitted
via Ajax and we see the errors.

Now click back to the homepage. I'm going to revisit the registration page. But
watch closely when I do. Woh! For *just* a moment, we saw the form *with* the
values filled in and the validation errors!

Here's what happened. When we were originally on the registration page with the
validation errors showing, we clicked to leave the page to go to the homepage.
At *that* moment - *just* before we were navigated away, Turbo saved the snapshot
for the registration page. That means the snapshot was for a page that had
filled-in form fields and validation errors.

Then, when we clicked back to the registration page, that snapshot was restored
with errors and all. A moment later, when the Ajax call finished, the fresh content -
with an empty form - replaced the snapshot.

This is a known issue with submitted forms. And... well... maybe it's not really an
issue. It's... tricky. And maybe you don't really care that this shows up for a
moment before it clears. In that case, just ignore it and move on with your
life! Go grab a baguette!

## How to Handle Problematic Snapshots

But let's say that we *do* want to avoid this. One option is that we could disable
the snapshot from being taken on this page *completely*. But when I fill out the
form... and get the errors... and go to the homepage... and then hit the "back"
button in my browser, it *is* nice that, thanks to the snapshot, we see the form
*with* the fields still filled-in. So... you kind of want the snapshot cache to be
used when hitting the back button... but not for the preview.

There are two main ways to fix the problem of a "bad snapshot". The first
involves *preparing* a page before its snapshot is taken. We could clear the form
errors and empty the fields so that the snapshot is clean. The code to do this
would work for *any* form on your site... so it would kind of take care of everything
all at once. The only downside is that clicking the back button would show an empty
form. We're not going to use this solution in *this* case, but we will leverage this
soon for a different preview problem.

## Disabling the Preview on a Page

A second solution is to simply disable the preview feature for *this* page. And,
that's one of the nice things about Turbo. Don't like something? Just disable it.

How? By adding a special `meta` tag to the `head` element. Head over to the code and
open up `templates/base.html.twig`. We don't want to remove the preview functionality
for *every* page. So instead of adding the `meta` tag right here, add a block so that
a *child* template can add new meta elements: `{% block metas %}` `{% endblock %}`.

[[[ code('eeb4f61ac5') ]]]

Now open up `templates/registration/register.html.twig` and override that block:
`{% block metas %}`, `{% endblock %}` and inside add `<meta>`
`name="turbo-cache-control"` with `content="no-preview"`.

The `no-preview` means: don't show a preview for this page. The other possible value
is `no-cache`, which tells Turbo to not do *any* snapshotting: not even for the back
button.

Let's see how this feels! Refresh the registration page, fill out the form with
errors and click away from this page. Now, click back to it. Beautiful! Instead of
instantly showing the preview, it stayed on the previous page until the new Ajax
call finished loading, just like a *normal* navigation. You can repeat this for
any pages that have a public-facing form where you care enough to avoid this problem.

## Dimming the Opacity of a Preview

Speaking of the preview feature, you can also change what a preview *looks*
like... in case you want to make it more obvious that a preview is being shown or
give it a "loading" feel. How? Open your Elements inspector. It's quick, but
watch this `html` element. Whenever you navigate and a preview is rendered, Turbo
will add a `data-turbo-preview` attribute to the `html` element.

Boom! It was fast, but I saw it! Let's use that to see if we can lower the *opacity*
on previews.

Head over to `assets/styles/app.css`. Target that attribute using the lesser-known
attribute syntax: `[data-turbo-preview]` then `body` to apply some body styling.
Set the `opacity` to .2 so it's really obvious.

[[[ code('fd0015dfff') ]]]

Let's go check it! Refresh. As we click to new pages, we don't see anything. But
if we click to a page that we've been to... yes! The whole page was nearly invisible
while the preview was being shown. This is also kind of a fun way, while you're
developing, to get a feel for when a preview is shown.

But... since this looks a bit extreme, let's go back to `app.css` and comment it
out.

[[[ code('e3f384d397') ]]]

Next: in addition to the form situation we just saw, there's one other common
time when the preview feature will do something that... we don't want. Let's talk
about what happens when something like a modal is open at the moment a snapshot is
taken.
