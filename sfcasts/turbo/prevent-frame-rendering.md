# Prevent a turbo-frame from Rendering

As usual, I'm going to complicate things! But I have a good reason: I really
want us to get the most out of frames... *and* we have a bug hiding.

Head over to `ProductAdminController`. As we just talked about, this redirects to
the `product_admin_index` page. Let's pretend that we want to redirect this to the
"reviews" page for the new product. Change this to `app_product_reviews` and pass
the `id` wildcard set to the new id: `$product->getId()`.

[[[ code('c72001e72d') ]]]

Cool. But this change won't affect our modal. When the modal submit is successful,
we're simply closing the modal, staying on the page and completely *ignoring*
the frame that lives in the now-closed modal. This new redirect would only affect us
if we went directly to the `/new` admin page where the form targets the full page.

So, since this won't affect us, it shouldn't break anything! Famous last words.
Refresh, open the modal, add some details and submit. Oh! The modal *did* close...
but we have an error in the console!

> Response has no matching `<turbo-frame id="product-info">` element.

Ah, the problem is that, even though we closed the modal, the `turbo-frame`
*still* followed the redirect to the product review page. Then, like it *always*
does, it looked for a `<turbo-frame>` with `id="product-info"`... which that
page doesn't have.

So what we *really* want to do is just... close the modal and tell turbo to *not*
follow the redirect. Unfortunately, the `turbo:submit-end` event is too late to tell
Turbo to do that!

We could ignore this error... or hack an empty turbo-frame onto the reviews page...
but let's fix this properly. It's a good challenge.

## Order of Turbo Events

When we submit this form, *four* events are triggered in this order:
`turbo:before-fetch-request`, `turbo:submit-start`, `turbo:before-fetch-response`
and finally `turbo:submit-end`. *Then* the frame is rendered.

But, wait a second. If the frame isn't rendered until *after* `turbo:submit-end`,
why is it too late to tell Turbo to *not* render the frame? The truth is that
`turbo:submit-end` isn't *actually* too late. The *real* problem is that Turbo
doesn't give us a way to *cancel* rendering from this event. But it *does* give
us this power from the event right *before* this: `turbo:before-fetch-response`.

## turbo:before-fetch-response

This event is triggered right *after* the Ajax call finishes, actually after
*both* Ajax calls have finished: the form submit POST *and* the second request to
the redirected page. But at this point, the frame has *not* been re-rendered.

***TIP
Starting in Turbo 7 RC4 (and so also in the stable Turbo 7), the `turbo:before-fetch-response` event
*is* now triggered from whatever element triggered the Ajax call. This means that you can
now use `this.element.addEventListener` instead of attaching it to `document`. Nice!
***

This time, we *do* need to attach the event to `document` because this event is
dispatched directly there - not on the form. For now, I'm going to *not* hide the
modal.

[[[ code('e7b1f2427c') ]]]

Refresh, open the modal and fill out the form so we can see what the event looks
like for a successful form submit. Cool. In the console, we see *two* of these
events. The first happened when we opened the modal: that's the GET request to
load the form. The second is from the form submit.

Open this up and look at the `detail` property: it has a `fetchResponse` object
and inside of it that... awesome! A `succeeded` key and a `redirected` key!
So it tells us if the request was successful and *also* if it was redirected.

So here's the plan: when this event happens, *if* a modal is open *and* the Ajax
call was successful *and* the Ajax call was a redirect, we'll *assume* that a form
was just submitted and hide the modal.

Back in the listener function, delete the code. Then, if *not* `this.modal` - so
if the modal has never opened - or if *not* `this.modal._isShown` - an internal way
to detect whether a modal is visible - then we don't need to do anything.
Just `return`.

But if the modal *is* open, set `const fetchResponse` to `event.detail.fetchResponse`:
that's the object we were just looking at. If `fetchResponse.succeeded` *and*
`fetchResponse.redirected`, then we're going to assume this was a successful form
submit and hide the modal.

## Cancelling the Frame Render

If we stopped now, this would do the *exact* same thing as before... just with
more code. It would hide the modal... but then the frame would *still* try to render
and give us that annoying error. But there's a key difference between this event
and `turbo:submit-end`: *this* event is *cancellable*. In this event we're allowed
to say `event.preventDefault()`.

[[[ code('8adf4ddec6') ]]]

Normally, we use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent form submits or link
clicks. Some custom events - like this one - *also* allow you to call this method...
and it could mean *anything* based on the event. In this case, it communicates to
Turbo that we would like to *prevent* this response from rendering.

Let's try it. Refresh, open, fill out the form and submit. Yes! The modal closed...
*this* time with *no* error!

We're amazing! Oh, except... hmm... this still isn't quite what we want. The
modal closed... but the page didn't reload or refresh... so we don't see the
new product in the list immediately. Let's fix that next and finish our
Turbo-powered modal system.
