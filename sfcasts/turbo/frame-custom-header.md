# Adding a Custom Request Header Based on the Frame

Okay, so if we don't want to cheat and use the internal `restore` action with
a Turbo visit, how *else* can we solve our problem? Well, there's really only one
option. Let me reopen my network tools. Right now, when we successfully submit into
a `<turbo-frame>`, like this modal, the frame follows the redirect, meaning it
makes a request to the redirected URL. *Then* we navigate to that same URL, which
causes a *second* request to it. Somehow, we need to avoid having these *two*
requests.

So if we can't force Turbo to directly use the response from this first Ajax call,
because we don't want to use the internal `restore` action, then our only choice
is to somehow *prevent* that first Ajax call from happening at all. But since the
JavaScript `fetch()` function *always* follows redirects, the only real way to do
this is to make Symfony *not* return a real redirect after a successful form
submit.

So here's the idea... it's kind of crazy. In Symfony, we're going to *detect* if
a request is being sent via a `turbo-frame` *and* if that frame has the
`data-turbo-form-redirect` attribute. If both of these are true and *if* the
`Response` from the controller is a redirect, we will change the `Response` to...
*not* be a redirect! We'll return a normal 200 status code but store the URL
that we *want* to redirect to as header on the response. Then, we'll prevent Turbo
from rendering that response, like we already are, read the URL from the header,
navigate with Turbo and voil√†! We redirect the page *without* the duplicate request.

## Sending data-turbo-form-redirect to the Server

So where do we start? Turbo already adds a `Turbo-Frame` header to any Ajax
request that happen inside a frame. We can see this, for example, down on the
POST request. All the way near the bottom... there it is: `turbo-frame: product-info`.
We can read that in Symfony.

But what we *can't* yet read in Symfony is whether or not this frame has the
`data-turbo-form-redirect` attribute. To make that possible, let's hook into
Turbo and add that information as a *new* request header.

In `turbo-helper.js`, we need to listen to another event. Head up to the
`constructor()`... and say `document.`. Actually, cheat. Steal the event
listener code from below... and change the event to `turbo:before-fetch-request`.

Remember: Turbo dispatches this event right *before* it makes *any* Ajax request.
Inside, call a new method - `this.beforeFetchRequest()` - and pass the `event`.

Copy that method name, head down to the methods... and add that with the `event`
argument. Inside, `console.log(event)` so we can see what it looks like.

Back at our browser, refresh. This logs *every* time Turbo makes an Ajax request,
like when we navigate... or a frame loads. This is from the weather frame. And I
think if we go down to the bottom... yep! It fires again when the *second* weather
frame loads.

Head over to the cart page, clear the console, then add an item to the cart. Ooh,
the event triggered *three* times. One was for the submit, one for the navigation
to the next page and the last was for the weather widget that loaded on this page.

## Detecting if the Frame Request has data-turbo-form-redirect

Check out the first log, which is from the POST request when we submit the form
into the frame. Ah, `event.detail` has a `fetchOptions` key! This is the collection
of options that are *about* to be passed to the `fetch()` function. And it has a
`headers` key with `Turbo-Frame` inside.

That's no surprise... but we can use that in JavaScript to figure out if this frame
has the special `data-turbo-form-redirect` attribute.

Check it out: say `const frameId =` and *read* that header:
`event.detail.fetchOptions.headers`...  and we're looking `Turbo-Frame`. We need
to use square brackets instead of `.` because the key has a dash in it.

Now, if there is *not* a `frameId`, then this request is *not* happening inside
a frame. In that case, do nothing.

But if we *do* have a `frameId`, we can *use* that to find this element:
`const frame = document.querySelector()`... and then use ticks so we can look
for `#` then `${frameId}`.

Yep, we're literally finding that `<turbo-frame>` element on the page! If we
can't find the frame for some reason - which shouldn't happen - *or* if the
frame does *not* have the dataset of `turboFormRedirect`, then do nothing.
Whoops - make sure that's `turboFormRedirect`.

Go back to the cart page and inspect element on the frame. As a reminder,
this *does* have the `data-turbo-form-redirect="true"` attribute. That's what
we're looking for.

At this point, we know that the request *is* happening in a frame and that the
frame *does* have the `data-turbo-form-redirect` attribute. And so, we're going
to add a new header. Use `event.detail.fetchOptions.headers` again to invent a
new header called, how about, `Turbo-Frame-Redirect`. Set it to `1`.

[[[ code('91e4bb1a84') ]]]

Cool! Let's go check it! At your browser, any normal request - even a request inside
a frame like for the weather widget - will *not* have the new header. Check
the weather frame request. All the way down... yep! It *does* have a `turbo-frame`
header... but *not* `turbo-frame-redirect`.

But now go back to the cart and clear the requests. Submit the form... scroll
up to that request... and scroll down. There it is! `turbo-frame-redirect`!
We can now *detect* - from Symfony - when a request is going through this type
of a frame. Oh yes, we're dangerous.

Next, let's turn to the Symfony side of things where we'll use this header to
magically transform redirect responses into something that we can better handle
in JavaScript.
