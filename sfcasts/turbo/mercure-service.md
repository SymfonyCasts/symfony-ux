# Running the Mercure Service in the symfony Binary

Mercure itself is a "service" or "server" - kind of like MySQL or Elasticsearch.
The Mercure server is called the "hub"... and there are several good ways to get
it running. First, they have a managed version where they handle it all for you.
This is great for production: it keeps things simple *and* you can help support
the project.

Or, you can download Mercure and set it up locally. *Or* you can set up Mercure
with Docker - that's totally supported. Or the *final* or is... *if* you're using
the Symfony binary as your local web server then... well... it's already running!

## The Embedded Mercure Hub

Head to your open terminal tab, clear the screen and run:

```terminal
symfony server:status
```

As a reminder, *way* back at the start of this tutorial, we used the Symfony
binary to run a local web server for us. Back at the browser, open a new tab
and go to https://127.0.0.1:8000 - the URL to our site - then `/.well-known/mercure`.

***TIP
The latest `symfony` binary no longer embeds Mercure. But it's still easy
to set up. First, add a `mercure` service to your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
# ...
###> symfony/mercure-bundle ###
    mercure:
        image: dunglas/mercure
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            # Uncomment the following line to disable HTTPS,
            SERVER_NAME: ':80'
            MERCURE_PUBLISHER_JWT_KEY: '!ChangeThisMercureHubJWTSecretKey!'
            MERCURE_SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY: '!ChangeThisMercureHubJWTSecretKey!'
            # Set the URL of your Symfony project (without trailing slash!) as value of the cors_origins directive
            MERCURE_EXTRA_DIRECTIVES: |
                cors_origins http://127.0.0.1:8000
        # Comment the following line to disable the development mode
        command: /usr/bin/caddy run --config /etc/caddy/dev.Caddyfile
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "https://localhost/healthz"]
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 5
            start_period: 60s
        volumes:
            - mercure_data:/data
            - mercure_config:/config
        ports: ['80']
###< symfony/mercure-bundle ###

volumes:
###> symfony/mercure-bundle ###
    mercure_data:
    mercure_config:
###< symfony/mercure-bundle ###
```

And start the container by running:

```terminal
docker compose up -d
```

That's it! But instead of being accessible at the URL you see in the tutorial,
the Mercure hub will be exposed on a random port. To find it, run:

```terminal
symfony var:export --multiline | grep MERCURE
```

And look for the `MERCURE_URL` value - it should equal something similar to
`http://127.0.0.1:64150/.well-known/mercure`. Put *this* into your address
bar to see your Mercure Hub (you'll see the same error as in the video).
***

If everything is working... yes! You should see this error:

> Missing "topic" parameter.

This *is* a Mercure hub. Yup, the Symfony binary comes with Mercure *already*
running at this URL. We get that for free.

## The Environment Variables

To communicate with this, head back over to your editor and open the `.env` file.

[[[ code('d434b0be49') ]]]

These three environment variables define values that are used in a new
config file: `config/packages/mercure.yaml`. `MERCURE_PUBLIC_URL` is the
*public* URL to the Mercure hub that our JavaScript will use to *subscribe* to
messages and `MERCURE_URL` is the URL that our PHP code will use to *publish*
messages. These are usually the same. `MERCURE_SECRET` is basically a password
that will allow us to publish: more on that later.

[[[ code('e64411d5e3') ]]]

In our case, both URL variables *already*, by chance, point to the correct URL!
Yay! But actually, if you're using the latest version of the Symfony binary... we
don't even *need* these variables in this file! Why? Well, in addition to setting
up Mercure for us, the Symfony binary *also* sets these environment variables
automatically to their correct values.

Check it out. Back over in our editor, open `public/index.php`. Let me close a
few things... then open it. Cool. Right after the runtime load, I'll paste in
some code.

[[[ code('a7f4de90da') ]]]

This looks fancy, but I'm basically dumping the `$_SERVER` variable... except
only the keys that contain `MERCURE`. The `$_SERVER` variable - among other things -
will contain all environment variables. I'm filtering for `MERCURE` basically...
because I don't want to accidentally publish any secret keys from my computer
to the internet... as much fun as that would be.

*Anyways*, this will run *before* the `.env` file is loaded, so it will only
print *real* environment variables. Back over on our site, refresh!

***TIP
If you're using the `docker-compose.yaml` setup described earlier, you will
only see 2 environment variables here... which are the only 2 you need anyways.
***

Yay! We see 4 environment variables including 2 we need! The first one is just
a flag that tells us that the Symfony binary is running Mercure... and that last
one is there for legacy reasons: we don't need it.

This means that our app is already configured and *ready* to talk to our Mercure
Hub! In production, you'll need to run a *real* Mercure Hub and set these environment
variables manually, however you do that in your hosting environment.

So... we have a Mercure hub running! What does that... mean? Well, it's a central
place where some things can *listen* for messages and other things can *publish*
messages. Next, let's do both of these things: listen to a Mercure "topic" in
JavaScript and publish messages to it, both from the command line - just to see
how it works - and from PHP, which is our *real* goal.
